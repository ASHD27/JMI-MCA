During the workshop he gives 5 programs to solve & he also explains these as well.

1) computing factorial of a number using recursion.
2) Printing the nth term of fibonacii series using recursion.
3) Computing the square root of any number in O(log n) time complexity using binary search.
4) checking a given array is sorted or not using recursion.
5) Printing all possible of balanced parenthesis using recursion.
